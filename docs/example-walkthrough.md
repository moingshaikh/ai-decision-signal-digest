# Example Walkthrough

## Purpose

This document demonstrates how the AI Decision Signal Digest operates end to end using a realistic collaboration scenario.

The goal is to show:
- How raw inputs are observed
- How classification logic is applied
- What the final digest output looks like
- What the system deliberately avoids doing

This walkthrough uses real timestamps and avoids content interpretation.

---

## Scenario Context

A cross-functional team is collaborating on a shared folder for a customer-facing product launch.

Roles involved:
- Product
- Sales
- Finance

**Folder**
`/GoToMarket/Q2_Launch/`

**Observation Window**
March 3, 2025, 09:00 → March 5, 2025, 10:00 (local workspace time)

---

## Step 1: Raw Inputs Observed

### Input A: File Change Event

- **File name:** `Launch_Pricing_Proposal_v3.docx`
- **File type:** Document
- **Change type:** Major edit
- **Timestamp:** March 3, 2025, 14:10
- **Actor role:** Product
- **Change magnitude:** Major

---

### Input B: Comment and Annotation Thread

- **Thread ID:** T-204
- **Associated file:** `Launch_Pricing_Proposal_v3.docx`
- **Comment count:** 7
- **Unresolved replies:** Yes
- **Explicit questions detected:** Yes
- **Participant roles:** Product, Sales, Finance
- **Last activity timestamp:** March 5, 2025, 09:45

Observed signals (structural only):
- Multiple replies across roles
- Presence of explicit question markers
- Edits occurring shortly after discussion

---

### Input C: Mentions

- **Mention type:** User mention
- **Target role:** Finance Lead
- **Location:** Comment thread T-204
- **Timestamp:** March 5, 2025, 08:50

---

### Input D: File Metadata Context

- **Number of collaborators:** 6
- **Owner role:** Product
- **Folder path:** `/GoToMarket/Q2_Launch/`
- **Recent activity spike:** Yes (within last 24 hours)

---

## Step 2: Apply Decision Classification Logic

The system evaluates the observed inputs using the deterministic rules defined in `decision-classification-logic.md`.

### Informational — Rejected

Fails required conditions due to:
- Explicit questions present
- Unresolved comment thread
- Multiple stakeholders involved
- Elevated activity intensity

---

### Action Required — Rejected

Although a mention is present, this category is disqualified because:
- Multiple viewpoints are implied
- No single action would resolve the situation
- Resolution requires alignment, not execution

---

### Decision Pending — Selected

Meets multiple required conditions:
- Explicit uncertainty via questions
- Cross-functional participation
- Major edits followed by discussion
- Repeated activity without resolution
- No clear owner capable of unblocking independently

This classification is supported without inference.

---

## Step 3: Final Classification

**Decision Pending**

No downgrade is required.

---

## Step 4: Digest Output (User-Facing)

This is the surfaced output generated by the AI Decision Signal Digest.

---

### Decision Pending  
**Launch Pricing Proposal – Alignment Required**

**Why this surfaced**  
Recent activity indicates unresolved discussion involving Product, Sales, and Finance. Multiple edits and open questions suggest alignment is required before progress can continue.

**Key signals observed**
- Major document revision on March 3, 2025 at 14:10
- Active comment thread with unresolved replies (last updated March 5, 2025 at 09:45)
- Explicit mention directed at Finance on March 5, 2025 at 08:50
- Multiple collaborators contributing within a short observation window

**Source references**
- `Launch_Pricing_Proposal_v3.docx`
- Comment thread T-204

**What this means**  
A decision is pending. Further execution is likely blocked until agreement is reached.

---

## Step 5: Guardrails in Action

In this scenario, the system deliberately does not:
- Suggest a pricing decision
- Summarize stakeholder opinions
- Assign ownership or deadlines
- Estimate urgency numerically
- Escalate beyond classification

Ambiguity is surfaced, not resolved by the system.

---

## Why This Example Matters

This walkthrough illustrates that the AI Decision Signal Digest:
- Operates solely on observable signals
- Uses real timestamps and traceable evidence
- Treats ambiguity as a meaningful state
- Avoids overreach into judgment or enforcement

The value lies in protecting decision clarity, not replacing decision-makers.

---

## Status

This walkthrough represents a complete and realistic example.

Additional scenarios could be added for contrast, but are not required for the artifact to stand on its own.
